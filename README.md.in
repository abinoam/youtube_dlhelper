## Introduction
The youtube_dlhelper is a short tool for download and manage the downloaded files.
You are running the program inside the command line with a Youtube URL. Then it
asks for a group name or interpreters name. Now it creates a Subfolder inside
your Musicdirectory. Then it makes a MP3 from the downloaded file and moves it
to the folder.

The CHANGELOG contains a detailed description on what has changed. For most
users the NEWS file might be a better place to look since it contains
change summaries between the different versions.

youtube_dlhelper is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3+,
see the file 'COPYING' for more information.

The official web site is:

    @PACKAGE_URL@

## Synopsis

## Contributing

### Ideas
  
* If have some good ideas for stuff that you want to see in this program you
should check the TODO file first before sending email.

### Cool hacks

* Open a bugreport on @BUG_REPORT_URL@.
* Please use the -u flag when generating the patch as it makes the patch
  more readable.
* Write a good explanation of what the patch does.
* It is better to use git format-patch command: git format-patch HEAD^

### Maintanance Policy

I'm following the Semantic Versioning for its releases: (Major).(Minor).(Patch).

 * Major version: Whenever there is something significant or any backwards
   incompatible changes.
 * Minor version: When new, backwards compatible functionality is introduced a
   minor feature is introduced, or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.
 * Patch number: When backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced that fix
   incorrect behavior.
 * The current stable release will receive security patches and bug fixes
   (eg. 5.0 -> 5.0.1).
 * Feature releases will mark the next supported stable release where the minor
   version is increased numerically by increments of one (eg. 5.0 -> 5.1).

I encourage everyone to run the latest stable release to ensure that you can
easily upgrade to the most secure and feature rich experience. In order to
make sure you can easily run the most recent stable release, we are working
hard to keep the update process simple and reliable.
